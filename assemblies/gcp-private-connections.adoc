If your {product-title} cluster privacy is set to *Private*, you must configure private connections in your {GCP} account to access the cluster.

You can use one or more of the following methods to establish a private connection to your cluster:

* Configuring AWS VPC peering: Enable Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) peering to route network traffic between two private IP addresses.

* Configuring AWS VPN peering: Establish a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to securely connect your private network to your Amazon VPC.

* Configuring AWS Direct Connect: Configure AWS Direct Connect to establish a dedicated network connection between your private network and an AWS Direct Connect location.

.Prerequisites

- Your GCP account has been configured for use with {product-title}.

[NOTE]
====
At this time, private clusters are only enabled for Customer Cloud Subscriptions (CCS) on GCP.
====
