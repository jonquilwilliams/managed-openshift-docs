= Planning limits and scalability


[role="_abstract"]
Consider the following tested object maximums when you plan your {product-title} cluster.

These guidelines are based on a cluster of 27 workers in a multi-availability zone configuration. For smaller clusters, the maximums are lower. For larger clusters, infrastructure node sizing can become a large impacting factor to scalability. There are many factors that influence the stated thresholds, including the etcd version or storage data format.

Exceeding these limits does not necessarily mean that the cluster will fail. In most cases, exceeding these numbers results in lower overall performance.
