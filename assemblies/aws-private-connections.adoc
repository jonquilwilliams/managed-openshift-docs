If your {product-title} cluster privacy is set to *Private*, you must configure private connections in your {AWS} account to access the cluster.

To get started, xref:../modules/aws-access.adoc#aws-access[Configure AWS infrastructure access] for you {product-title} cluster.

After you have access to the {product-title} AWS account, use one or more of the following methods to establish a private connection to your cluster:

* xref:../modules/aws-vpc.adoc#aws-vpc[Configuring AWS VPC peering]: Enable Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) peering to route network traffic between two private IP addresses.

* xref:../modules/aws-vpn.adoc#aws-vpn[Configuring AWS VPN peering]: Establish a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to securely connect your private network to your Amazon VPC.

* xref:../modules/aws-direct-connect.adoc#aws-direct-connect[Configuring AWS Direct Connect]: Configure AWS Direct Connect to establish a dedicated network connection between your private network and an AWS Direct Connect location.
