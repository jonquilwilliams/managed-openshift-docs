= Upgrading with the rosa CLI

[role="_abstract"]
There are three methods that can be used to upgrade {product-title} clusters. This procedure describes upgrading using the `rosa` CLI.

This method schedules the cluster for an immediate upgrade, if a more recent version is available.

.Procedure

. To verify the current version of your cluster, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa describe cluster
----

. To verify that an upgrade is available, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa list upgrade --cluster=<cluster_name>
----
+
The command returns a list of versions to which the the cluster can be upgraded, including a recommended version.

. To upgrade a cluster to the latest available version, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa upgrade cluster --cluster=<cluster_name>
----
+
The cluster is scheduled for an immediate upgrade. This action can take an hour or longer, depending on your workload configuration, such as PodDisruptionBudgets.
+
You will receive an email when the upgrade is complete. You can also check the status by running `rosa describe cluster` again from the `rosa` CLI or view the status in the OpenShift Cluster Manager (OCM) console.
