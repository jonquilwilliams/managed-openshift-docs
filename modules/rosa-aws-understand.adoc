= Deployment Prerequisites
To deploy {product-title} (ROSA) into your existing Amazon Web Services (AWS) account, Red Hat requires that several prerequisites are met.

Red Hat recommends the usage of an AWS Organization to manage multiple AWS accounts. The AWS Organization, managed by the customer, hosts multiple AWS accounts. There is a root account in the organization that all accounts will refer to in the account hierarchy.

It is a best practice for the ROSA cluster to be hosted in an AWS account within an AWS Organizational Unit. A Service Control Policy (SCP) is created and applied to the AWS Organizational Unit that manages what services the AWS sub-accounts are permitted to access. The SCP applies only to available permissions within a single AWS account for all AWS sub-accounts within the Organizational Unit. It is also possible to apply a SCP to a single AWS account. All other accounts in the customerâ€™s AWS Organization are managed in whatever manner the customer requires. Red Hat Site Reliability Engineers (SRE) will not have any control over SCPs within the AWS Organization.
