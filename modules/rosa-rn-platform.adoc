[id="rosa-rn-platform_{context}"]
= Platform

[id="rosa-rn-backups_{context}"]
== Cluster backups

Application and application data backups are not a part of the {product-title} (ROSA) service. Customers must have their own backup strategy for their applications and application data.

All Kubernetes objects and persistent volumes (PVs) in each ROSA cluster are backed up to facilitate a prompt recovery in the unlikely event that a cluster becomes irreparably inoperable. These backups are stored in a secure object storage (multiple availability zone) bucket in the same account as the cluster.

Node root volumes are not backed up because Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS is fully managed by the OpenShift Container Platform cluster and no stateful data should be stored on a nodeâ€™s root volume.

[id="rosa-rn-autoscaling_{context}"]
== Autoscaling

Autoscaling is available through the `rosa` command-line. ROSA supports autoscaling on nodes. Autoscaling can be configured during cluster creation or on machine pools after a cluster is created.

[id="rosa-rn-daemonsets_{context}"]
== Daemonsets

Customers can create and run daemonsets on ROSA. Daemonsets can be limited to run on worker nodes using `nodeSelector`.

[id="rosa-rn-multi-az_{context}"]
== Multiple availability zone

In a multiple availability zone cluster, master nodes are distributed across availability zones and one worker node is required in each availability zone.

[id="rosa-rn-node-labels_{context}"]
== Node labels

Custom node labels can be defined on machine pools and cannot be edited after they are created.

[id="rosa-rn-versions_{context}"]
== OpenShift Container Platform Versions

ROSA runs as a service on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and is kept up-to-date with the latest OpenShift Container Platform version. For more information about versions, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift/dedicated[OpenShift Dedicated Life Cycle page].

[id="rosa-rn-upgrades_{context}"]
== Upgrades

Patch level updates, also known as `z-stream` or `x.y.Z`, are applied automatically the week following their release if the updates pass the ROSA-specific end-to-end tests.

Minor version updates, also known as `x.Y.z`, can include Kubernetes version upgrades and API changes. Customers are notified by email two weeks in advance before these upgrades are automatically applied.

Users can select either an automatic or manual upgrade strategy through OCM or the `rosa` CLI. Upgrade scheduling is also available through the `rosa` CLI.

[id="rosa-rn-windows-containers_{context}"]
== Windows Containers

Windows Containers are not available on ROSA at this time.

[id="rosa-rn-container-engine_{context}"]
== Container engine

ROSA runs on OpenShift Container Platform 4 and uses link:https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-openshift-container-platform-4-now-defaults-cri-o-underlying-container-engine[CRI-O] as the container engine.

[id="rosa-rn-operating-system_{context}"]
== Operating system

ROSA runs on OpenShift Container Platform 4 and uses Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS as the operating system for all master and worker nodes.

[id="rosa-rn-kubernetes-os_{context}"]
== Kubernetes Operator support

All of the Operators listed in the Operator Hub marketplace can be installed on ROSA. However, these Operators are customer workloads and are not monitored by Red Hat SRE.
