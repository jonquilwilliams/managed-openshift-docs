= Logging

{product-title} (ROSA) offers an optional logging stack based on Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana (EFK). The logging stack in OpenShift Container Platform is designed for short-term retention to aid application troubleshooting, not for long-term log archiving.

Application logging are supported. Application logs can be forwarded using the CloudWatch add-on service. Add-on services are configured using the `rosa` command-line.
