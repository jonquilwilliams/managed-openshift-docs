= About the Insights Operator

[role="_abstract"]
The Insights Operator periodically gathers configuration and component failure status and, by default, reports that data every two hours to Red Hat. This information enables Red Hat to assess configuration and deeper failure data than is reported through Telemetry.

Users of {product-title} can display the report of each cluster in {cloud-redhat-com}. If any issues have been identified, Insights provides further details and, if available, steps on how to solve a problem.

The Insights Operator does not collect identifying information, such as user names, passwords, or certificates. See link:https://cloud.redhat.com/security/insights[Red Hat Insights Data & Application Security] for information about Red Hat Insights data collection and controls.

Red Hat uses all connected cluster information to:

* Proactively identify potential cluster issues and provide a solution and preventive actions in {cloud-redhat-com}
* Improve {product-title} by providing aggregated and critical information to product and support teams
* Make {product-title} more intuitive


== Information collected by the Insights Operator

The following information is collected by the Insights Operator:

* General information about your cluster and its components to identify issues that are specific to your {product-title} version and environment
* Configuration files, such as the image registry configuration, of your cluster to determine incorrect settings and issues that are specific to parameters you set
* Errors that occur in the cluster components
* Progress information of running updates, and the status of any component upgrades
* Details of the platform that {product-title} is deployed on, such as Amazon Web Services, and the region that the cluster is located in
* If an Operator reports an issue, information is collected about core {product-title} pods in the `openshift-&#42;` and `kube-&#42;` projects. This includes state, resource, security context, volume information, and more.
