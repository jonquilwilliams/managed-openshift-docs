{product-title} provides optional integrated log forwarding to AWS CloudWatch.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-cluster-audit-logging_{context}"]
== Cluster audit logging
Cluster audit logs are always enabled. Audit logs are streamed to a log aggregation system outside the cluster VPC for automated security analysis and secure retention for 1 year. Red Hat controls the log aggregation system. Customers do not have access. Customers can receive a copy of their cluster's audit logs upon request through a support ticket. Audit log requests must specify a date and time range not to exceed 21 days. When requesting audit logs, customers should be aware that audit logs are many GB per day in size.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-application-logging_{context}"]
== Application logging
Application logs sent to `STDOUT` are collected by Fluentd and forwarded to AWS CloudWatch through the cluster logging stack, if it is installed.
