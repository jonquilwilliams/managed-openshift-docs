= Deleting a cluster

You can delete an {product-title} cluster using the `rosa` CLI.

If add-ons are installed, the deletion takes longer because add-ons are uninstalled before the cluster is deleted. The amount of time depends on the number and size of the add-ons.

.Procedure

. Enter the following command to delete a cluster and watch the logs, replacing `<cluster_name>` with the name or ID of your cluster:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ rosa delete cluster --cluster=<cluster_name> --watch
----

. To clean up your CloudFormation stack, enter the following command:
+
[source, terminal]
----
$ rosa init --delete-stack
----
