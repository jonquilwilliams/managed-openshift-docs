[role="_abstract"]
{product-title} clusters using a Customer Cloud Subscription (CCS) model on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) must meet several prerequisites before they can be deployed.


== Account

* Customer ensures link:https://cloud.google.com/storage/quotas[Google Cloud limits] are sufficient to support {product-title} provisioned within the customer-provided GCP account.

* The customer-provided GCP account should be in the customer's Google Cloud Organization with the applicable Service Account applied.

* The customer-provided GCP account should not be transferable to Red Hat.

* The customer may not impose GCP usage restrictions on Red Hat activities. Imposing restrictions will severely hinder Red Hat's ability to respond to incidents.

* Red Hat will deploy monitoring into GCP to alert Red Hat when a highly privileged account, such as a root account, logs into the customer-provided GCP account.

* The customer may deploy native GCP services within the same customer-provided GCP account.
+
[NOTE]
====
Customers are encouraged, but not mandated, to deploy resources in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) separate from the VPC hosting {product-title} and other Red Hat supported services.
====


== Access requirements

* To appropriately manage the {product-title} service, Red Hat must have the `AdministratorAccess` policy applied to the administrator role at all times.
+
[NOTE]
====
This policy only provides Red Hat with permissions and capabilities to change resources in the customer-provided GCP account.
====

* Red Hat must have GCP console access to the customer-provided GCP account. This access is protected and managed by Red Hat.

* The customer must not utilize the GCP account to elevate their permissions within the {product-title} cluster.

* Actions available in the {cloud-redhat-com} must not be directly performed in the customer-provided GCP account.


== Support requirements

* Red Hat recommends that the customer have at least link:https://cloud.google.com/support[Production Support] from GCP.

* Red Hat has authority from the customer to request GCP support on their behalf.

* Red Hat has authority from the customer to request GCP resource limit increases on the customer-provided account.

* Red Hat manages the restrictions, limitations, expectations, and defaults for all {product-title} clusters in the same manner, unless otherwise specified in this requirements section.


== Security requirements

* The customer-provided IAM credentials should be unique to the customer-provided GCP account and should not be stored anywhere in the customer-provided GCP account.

* Volume snapshots will remain within the customer-provided GCP account and customer-specified region.

* Red Hat must have ingress access to the API server through white-listed Red Hat machines.

* Red Hat must have egress allowed to forward system and audit logs to a Red Hat managed central logging stack.
