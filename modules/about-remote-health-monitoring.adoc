= About remote health monitoring

[role="_abstract"]
OpenShift Dedicated collects anonymized aggregated information about the health, usage, and size of clusters and reports it to Red Hat via two integrated components: Telemetry and the Insights Operator. This information allows Red Hat to improve OpenShift Dedicated and to react to issues that impact customers more quickly. This also simplifies the subscription and entitlement process for Red Hat customers and enables the Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager service to provide an overview of your clusters and their health and subscription status.

A cluster that reports data to Red Hat via Telemetry and the Insights Operator is considered a connected cluster.

[NOTE]
====
On {product-title}, remote health reporting is always enabled. You cannot opt out.

*Telemetry* is the term that Red Hat uses to describe the information being sent to Red Hat by the {product-title} Telemeter Client. Lightweight attributes are sent from connected clusters to Red Hat to enable subscription management automation, monitor the health of clusters, assist with support, and improve customer experience.

The *Insights Operator* gathers {product-title} configuration data and sends it to Red Hat. The data is used to produce insights about potential issues that a cluster might be exposed to. These insights are communicated to cluster administrators on {cloud-redhat-com}.


Telemetry and the Insights Operator enable the following benefits for end-users:

* *Enhanced identification and resolution of issues*. Events that might seem normal to an end-user can be observed by Red Hat from a broader perspective across a fleet of clusters. Some issues can be more rapidly identified from this point of view and resolved without an end-user needing to open a support case or file a Bugzilla.

* *Advanced release management*. {product-title} offers the `candidate`, `fast`, and `stable` release channels, which enable you to choose an update strategy. The graduation of a release from `fast` to `stable` is dependent on the success rate of updates and on the events seen during upgrades. With the information provided by connected clusters, Red Hat can improve the quality of releases to `stable` channels and react more rapidly to issues found in the `fast` channels.

* *Targeted prioritization of new features and functionality*. The data collected provides insights about which areas of {product-title} are used most. With this information, Red Hat can focus on developing the new features and functionality that have the greatest impact for our customers.

* *A streamlined support experience*. You can provide a cluster ID for a connected cluster when creating a support ticket on the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/[Red Hat Customer Portal]. This enables Red Hat to deliver a streamlined support experience that is specific to your cluster, by using the connected information. This document provides more information about that enhanced support experience.

* *Predictive analytics*. The insights displayed for your cluster on {cloud-redhat-com} are enabled by the information collected from connected clusters. Red Hat is investing in applying deep learning, machine learning, and artificial intelligence automation to help identify issues that {product-title} clusters are exposed to.
