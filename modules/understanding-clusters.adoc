= Understanding your cluster cloud options

[role="_abstract"]
{product-title} offers {OCP} clusters as a managed service on Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud Platform (GCP). You can you use your existing cloud account to leverage discounts, or purchase a standard cluster through Red Hat.

== Standard clusters

Standard {product-title} clusters are deployed into their own AWS or GCP infrastructure accounts, each owned by Red Hat. Red Hat is responsible for this account, and cloud infrastructure costs are paid directly by Red Hat. The customer will only pay the Red Hat subscription costs.

== Customer Cloud Subscription (CCS)
Red Hat {product-title} provides a Customer Cloud Subscription (CCS) model that allows Red Hat to deploy and manage {product-title} into a customer’s AWS or GCP account. Red Hat requires several prerequisites be met in order to provide this service and this service is supported by Red Hat Site Reliability Engineers (SRE).

In the Customer Cloud Subscription model, the customer pays the cloud infrastructure provider directly for cloud costs and the cloud infrastructure account will be part of a customer’s Organization, with specific access granted to Red Hat. The customer will have restricted access to this account, but will be able to view billing and usage information. In this model, the customer will pay Red Hat for the CCS subscription and will pay the cloud provider for the cloud costs
